# Daily Todo App

**The minimalist habit tracker that beats procrastination.**  
Start small. Grow daily. No excuses.

---

## Why it works

- **Progressive overload, built-in**  
  `Run 5 min` → `6` → `7`…  
  **Even if you skip 30 days — it remembers and continues.**

- **Zero friction**  
  Open → See today’s targets → Tap to complete → Done.  
  No settings. No overwhelm.

- **Daily reset at midnight**  
  Fresh start every day. No guilt.

- **Add any progressive task**  
  `Push-ups 5` → `+1/day` → `30 in a month`

## Design Philosophy

> **"The best habit app is the one you actually use."**

- No notifications  
- No streaks  
- No gamification  
- Just **you vs. today’s number**
